1)  installed stack driver on the instance with mongodb running, by downloading a installation script and running it with 
api key , from https://app.google.stackdriver.com/settings/apikeys/

- installing , https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/install-agent
- https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent/plugins/mongodb


2) once installed , need to add mongo plugin to stackdriver

3) restart, see if user auth is needed or not needed , if working correctly





# started mongo instance , 

nohup mongod --dbpath ./dbdata &


# to create an user
user quizapp;
db.createUser(
    {
      user: "abhinav",
      pwd: "warrior_within",
      roles: [
         { role: "readWrite", db: "telugubeats" }
      ]
    }
)
